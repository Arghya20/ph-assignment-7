                In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way to
                declare variables and that was using the var keyword. However,
                there were some issues associated with variables declared using
                the var keyword so it was necessary to evolve new ways for
                variable declaration. With the advent of ES6, now developers are
                able to define variables according to their specific needs,
                thanks to two new keywords: let and const.
                <br />
                <br />
                The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration
                in JavaScript include: Variables declared with var and const are
                scoped to the immediate function body. Variables declared with
                the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable
                can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are
                declared. Variables declared with the let keyword are
                block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the
                immediate enclosing block.

                Regular functions created using function declarations or
                expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular
                functions are constructible, they can be called using the new
                keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not
                constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as
                constructor functions.

                Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`)
                characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string
                interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special
                constructs called tagged templates.
                <br>
                <br>
                Template literals are
                sometimes informally called template strings, because they are
                used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings
                by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged
                template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with
                a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on
                the different parts of the template literal.

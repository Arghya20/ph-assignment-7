                localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs
                (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support them) and are
                near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole
                exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests)
                is only available for the duration of the browser session (and
                is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however,
                survive page reloads.
                <br />
                <br />
                Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an
                ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage
                - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so
                you should not rely on the continuing existence of data in
                either case.
                <br />
                <br />
                ocalStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting
                non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between pages
                (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in
                localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed
                from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for
                storage of sensitive or security-related data within
                applications.

                Global scope - A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a
                variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}),
                it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be
                accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside
                blocks.
                <br />
                <br />
                Block scope - So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var
                keyword. Var can declare a variable either in the global or
                local scope. The variables that are declared within the block
                scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within
                the block that they are defined.
                <br />
                The main difference between the local scope and block scope is
                that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops),
                don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an
                effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.

                The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack
                and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event
                Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it
                to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration
                is called a tick in the Event Loop.

                undefined typically means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. 
                <br>
                <br>
                You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent
                property or method of an object. In the above example, a
                function Sum does not return any result but still we try to
                assign its resulted value to a variable. So in this case, result
                will be undefined.
                <br />
                <br />
                variable that has not been assigned a value is of type
                undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the
                variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned
                value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.
